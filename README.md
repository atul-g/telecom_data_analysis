# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, I use the [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) dataset. The objective here is to make data visualization charts in order to understand the dataset and also perform necessary processing to prepare the dataset for training on ML models so that we can predict whether a certain customer will continue his/her subscription with a Telecom service provider or not based on certain related data.

This is also my capstone project for the final course of the IBM Advanced Data Science specialization course.
